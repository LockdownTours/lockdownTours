                First thing to mention is that they are both great cities and this battle is entirely subjective. Saying that, there can only be one winner! If you disagree with my analysis or think I’ve missed something out please don’t hesitate to yell at me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/LockdownTours" target="_blank">@lockdowntours </a>.

            <h2>People and culture</h2>
           <p>
            I’m a people person so I’m going to kick this comparison off with a difference in Osakan vs Tokyoite culture. People in Osaka are considered to be more friendly. Osaka has a strong comedy circuit, people tend to joke and be more extroverted while the general impression I get from people in Tokyo is they tend to be more quiet and shy. People in Tokyo say that people in Osaka never do any work while people in Osaka say Tokyo folks take life too seriously. To a foreign tourist like me both groups were incredibly polite and friendly. While, I struggle a lot with Osaka’s local dialect (Osaka-ben), I love how much Osakans light up when I ask them “Mokarimakka?" (Making money?). So this one goes to Osaka!

              <h2>Things to do!</h2>
                <p>
                  Let’s look at things to do! Osaka offers a great number of attractions. Take the Dotonbori neon lights, Osaka Castle or Kaiyukan Aquarium, your going to be busy! But Tokyo is just so much bigger! The Tokyo Tower, Asakusa Sensoji, Shibuya Crossing there’s just so much to do! I think Tokyo wins this one because there’s just more to offer and the selection of what to do is wider. However! If your looking to do a day trip. From Tokyo, I had a great time in Yokohama and I’ve always wanted to check out Kamakura. But overall, Osaka is the better travel hub - you can get to Kyoto (Japan’s tourist capital!) in about X minutes or day-trip to Nara (my favourite travel spot). So I guess we call this a draw?

              <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>
              How can we do a comparison and not consider food? Osaka’s food culture is hilarious. I appreciate rather than indulge in “kuidaore” (eat until you drop) and I love there local dishes like the infamous takoyaki or okonomiyaki. It’s street food at it’s best. Tokyo’s food culture has been shaped by the Edo period with foods like sushi, soba noodles and tempura. Maybe I’m old school but I just love Tokyo dining!  A true cultural experience through the harmony of traditional Japanese food and hospitality.

              Overall, they are both great cities and compaing diverse, huge pieces of land on three criteria is a bit of an injustice. But it would be a terrible article if I didn’t announce a winner! For me, I love Tokyo that little bit more than Osaka. It’s the happy middle between its intense but refined energy that give it the edge. The way too serious work-life combined with the incredibly frantic night-life, as a visiting foreigner, is just so strange and compelling. I will keep coming back to both cities but Tokyo has my fondest memories…. For now!
