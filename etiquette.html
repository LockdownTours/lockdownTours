                You may not realise your behaviour got against Japanese culture, so let us use our insider knowledge to help you get around Japan’s strict forms of etiquette and enhance your experience when you travel.
              </p>

            <h2>Don’t bend the rules</h2>
            <p>
              While most of us follow the law, some (like me) bend the rules to make life a little more convenient. In Japan, most people follow a strict moral code (see bashido) and fret over inconveniencing others. 
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, signals at crossings. It's highly encouraged that you obey (no jaywalking!). Japanese people usually don't cross the street when the signal is red despite the traffic. Frustrating at first but actually quite nice once you get used to the swing of things! 
            </p>
            <p>              
              The Japanese speak softly and if you don't want to annoy anyone outside of your group, try to speak so that only your group can hear you. On trains, it’s also considered bad manners if you talk on your cell phone.

              <h2>Keep cash</h2>
                <p>
                  Despite its high-tech status, Japan is cash-centred, and many establishments don’t accept credit cards, especially, your mom-and-pop shop. Forget about using a credit card for riding public transportation. You might see taxis advertising that they accept cards on their windows, but my only nightmare was when they couldn't process my british debit card and we had to de-tour to the nearest 711 (another good tip! They always have ATMs). Learn from my mistakes and always remember to ask before riding!

              <h2>No shoes</h2>
            <p>
              Be wary that you need to take off your shoes when entering a home and this can also apply to businesses, like restaurants! In a restaurant, a server will point out where to store your shoes and provide slippers for bathroom trips.
              Other places like onsens, won’t show you what to do. I tend to look for a collection of other people’s shoes when entering a property or (another clue) a recess from the main floor. If in doubt, ask!

            <h2>Don't tip</h2>
              <p>
                The price on the bill is the price you pay. In Shibuya, a ramen chef chased me down the street to return my money! 
                Restaurant employees usually get paid by the hour and don't depend on tips. I like how genuine it is that the service isn’t reliant on tips that patrons are sincere in their kindness.  If you’re really impressed by the service or have a . For instance, your impressed by the service by a nakai-san (private concierge) during your stay at a hotel, you can leave 1,000 JPY in an envelope in your room or discreetly at reception.
